# Task 1 (50pts)

[API Reference](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/)

## Problem Statement

1. Create a server with NodeJS/PHP to clone the above API. All the API data is located in `exercise.json` file under `files` folder.
2. You will read the `exercise.json` file and serve the requested data in json format to all the API endpoints. (You will see that there are 9 GET endpoints).
3. Create some pages to show every API response. To show array of strings, you can use lists. To show array of objects, you can use cards/tables. You are free to design this yourself.

## Solution

The `src/index.js` contains the API endpoint creation code.\
Because of the point allocation, not much effort has been put into data sanitization and security.\
The code has been kept minimalistic and adequately commented for better readability.
